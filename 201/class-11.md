1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

Since the early 2000s, the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved from proprietary plugins like Flash to open standards like HTML5. This transition has enabled the rise of platforms like YouTube and advancements like WebRTC for real-time communication. Additionally, adaptive streaming, improved codecs like AV1, and support for AR and VR have enhanced the multimedia experience on the web. Security and privacy measures have also been strengthened.

2. Describe the use of the `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element.

The `<video>` element in HTML is used to embed video content in web pages. Two important attributes for this element are `src` and `controls`:

* `src` Attribute:
The `src` attribute stands for "source" and is used to specify the URL of the video file you want to display on your web page.

* `controls` Attribute:
The `controls` attribute is a boolean attribute that, when present, adds playback controls to the video player, such as play, pause, volume, and a progress bar. Without the controls attribute, the video will be displayed but without any built-in controls, and users won't be able to interact with it using standard player functions.

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?

Fallback content inside the `<video>` element is important for browser compatibility, accessibility, error handling, SEO, and a better user experience. It provides an alternative when the video format isn't supported, improves accessibility, and helps in cases of technical issues or for SEO.

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

Developers should make images responsive to improve website loading speed, save bandwidth, enhance user experience, support SEO, ensure accessibility, and maintain consistency across various devices and screen sizes.

2. Define the following `<img>` attributes `srcset` and `sizes`. Write an example of how they are used.

The `<img>` attributes `srcset` and `sizes` are used to provide responsive images that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. Here's a brief explanation and an example of how they are used:

* srcset Attribute:
The srcset attribute allows you to specify multiple image sources with different resolutions and sizes. The browser can then choose the most appropriate image based on the user's device and display capabilities.
Each source in srcset is defined with a URL and a descriptor that indicates the image's width or pixel density.
* sizes Attribute:
The sizes attribute is used to provide information to the browser about how the image will be displayed in terms of viewport width. It helps the browser determine the appropriate image source to download.
sizes is specified using media queries, where you define the image's display size based on viewport width.

3. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

`srcset` is more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript because it's native, efficient, automatically selects the right image, improves performance, enhances accessibility, supports SEO, and simplifies implementation and maintenance.
