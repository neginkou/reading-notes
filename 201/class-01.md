### Designing a website with a strong emphasis on web semantics and JavaScript is crucial in our current module. Web semantics ensures accessibility and SEO, while JavaScript adds interactivity. These skills are essential for creating modern, functional, and user-friendly websites

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

 *HTTP, a bridge from you to me. It travels through the digital stream,
A messenger of every dream.*

2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are parsed by the browser in a sequential manner to render a web page.

* The browser first retrieves the HTML file from the web server.
* HTML parsing starts from the top of the file and proceeds line by line.
* The parser recognizes the HTML tags and constructs a Document Object Model (DOM) tree, representing the structure of the web page.
* The DOM tree includes elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and more.
* The CSS parser interprets the rules defined in the CSS file. It associates styles with the corresponding HTML elements based on selectors.
* The browser creates a CSS Object Model (CSSOM) based on the parsed CSS. The CSSOM holds information about how elements should be styled, including properties like color, font, margin, and padding.
* JavaScript is parsed and executed, allowing for dynamic interactions and changes.

3. How can you find images to add to a Website?

most images on the web, including in Google Images, are copyrighted. To reduce our likelihood of violating copyright, You can use Google's license filter. Click on the Tools button, then on the resulting Usage rights option that appears below. You should choose the option Creative Commons licenses.

4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks. Numbers don't have quotes around them.

5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable, a semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.

1. What is an HTML attribute?

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
An attribute should have:

* A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
* The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
* An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.

2. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.

* The opening tag: Opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect.
* The content: the content of the element. It is the paragraph text.
* The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.

3. What is the Difference between *article* and *section* element tags?

*article* encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page.
*section* is similar to *article*, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality.

4. What Elements does a “typical” website include?

Header, Navigation bar,main content, Article, Section, Divide and, footer.

5. How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

 Metadata provides search engines with vital information about your webpage's content and structure. Optimizing metadata elements, including title tags, meta descriptions, and image alt text, can improve your site's visibility in search results, encourage higher CTR, and ultimately contribute to better SEO.

 6. How is the *meta* HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

 The *meta* HTML tag is used to specify various types of metadata within a webpage. This metadata provides information about the document or controls its behavior in different ways. The *meta* tag is typically placed within the *head* section of an HTML document.

1. What is the first step to designing a Website?

The first step to designing a website is typically to define its purpose and gather requirements. This involves understanding the goals, objectives, and target audience for the website.

2. What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?
So when you get an idea and want to turn it into a website, there are a few questions you should answer before anything else:

* What exactly do I want to accomplish?
* How will a website help me reach my goals?
* What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

All of this is called project ideation and is a necessary first step to reach your goal, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer.

1. Why should you use an *h1* element over a *span* element to display a top level heading?

The h1 element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page." *span* will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.

2. What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

* Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings.
* Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.
* Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes.
* Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
* Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.

2. How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?

JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses *link* elements to apply external stylesheets and *style* elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the *script* element.
