## Things I want to know more about

1. What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?

Chart.js is a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs in web applications. It provides an easy-to-use and customizable way to represent data in various chart types, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and more. Chart.js is open-source and widely used for data visualization in web development.

2. List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.

* Bar Chart: A bar chart is used to display data in horizontal or vertical bars, with the length or height of each bar representing the value of a data point. Bar charts are effective for comparing values between different categories or items.
* Line Chart: A line chart is used to represent data as a series of data points connected by straight lines. It's suitable for showing trends and changes in data over time. Line charts are often used for time series data or data that changes continuously.
* Pie Chart: A pie chart is a circular chart divided into sectors, where each sector represents a portion of a whole. It's useful for showing the composition or distribution of data as parts of a whole. Pie charts are commonly used when you want to visualize data in percentages or proportions.
