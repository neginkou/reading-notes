# My Learning Journal

**What "_growth mindset_" means to me is a belief or attitude that individuals can develop and improve their abilities, skills, and intelligence over time through dedication, effort, and learning.** 

* Embrace Challenges:
Remind yourself that challenges are opportunities for growth. Instead of avoiding difficult tasks or situations, welcome them as chances to learn and develop your skills.

* Learning Opportunity:
Understand that failure is a natural part of the learning process. Don't be discouraged by setbacks; instead, view them as valuable feedback that can help you improve.

* Cultivate Persistence:
Stay committed to your goals and aspirations, even when faced with obstacles.
