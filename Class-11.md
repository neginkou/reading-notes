1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL Feature          | SQL Description                                              | NoSQL Feature        | NoSQL Description                                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Structure        | Relational with structured schema                            | Data Structure       | Non-relational with various data models (document, key-value, etc.) |
| Schema                | Predefined schema required                                    | Schema               | Schema-less or dynamic schema                                    |
| Scalability           | Vertically scalable, adding more powerful hardware to a server | Scalability          | Horizontally scalable, adding more servers to a distributed system |
| Query Language        | SQL (Structured Query Language)                                | Query Language        | Depends on the type of NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)   |
| Consistency           | ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Consistency           | CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)      |


1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are well-suited for structured, relational data with clear relationships. They excel in scenarios requiring complex queries, transactions (ACID properties), and data integrity. SQL is a good fit for applications where a defined schema and standardized querying are crucial. Additionally, they scale vertically and benefit from a mature ecosystem with widespread community support.

2. Give a real world example.

In an e-commerce platform, an SQL database is well-suited for managing structured product data, order information, and complex queries. It ensures transaction reliability, maintains data integrity, and supports scalability as the platform grows. For example, SQL databases efficiently handle relationships between tables like "Products," "Orders," and "Customers," providing a robust foundation for e-commerce data management.

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases are ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data, offering flexibility in schema design. They excel in scenarios requiring horizontal scalability, diverse data models (key-value, column-family, graph), and rapid, dynamic development. NoSQL databases are commonly used in big data, real-time applications, and situations where data structures evolve frequently. They provide developers with productivity benefits and are well-suited for handling nested or hierarchical data structures.

4. Give a real world example.

In a social media platform, a NoSQL database like MongoDB is well-suited for handling diverse and evolving user profiles, dynamic content types, and scalable data storage. It enables quick access to personalized feeds, supports global distribution of data, and adapts seamlessly to changing features without compromising performance. The flexibility and scalability of NoSQL databases align with the dynamic nature of social media applications.

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

For hierarchical data storage, a document-oriented NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firebase Realtime Database is often the best choice. These databases excel at handling nested and hierarchical structures, making them suitable for scenarios such as organizational hierarchies or nested categories.

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

For scalability, NoSQL databases are often preferred. Key-Value stores like Redis, Wide-Column stores such as Apache Cassandra, and Document-Oriented databases like MongoDB are known for horizontal scalability, accommodating growing data volumes by adding more nodes. Graph databases like Neo4j excel in handling highly connected data. The choice depends on your application's specific needs and data characteristics.

1. What does SQL stand for?

SQL stands for "Structured Query Language," a standard programming language for managing and interacting with relational databases.

2. What is a relational database?

A relational database organizes data into tables with rows and columns, using keys to establish relationships. It is managed by a relational database management system (RDBMS) and enables structured data storage and retrieval using SQL. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A relational database works with a tabular structure, organizing data into tables with rows and columns.

4. What is a ‘schema’?

A 'schema' in a database defines the organization and structure of data, including tables, fields, relationships, and constraints. It serves as a blueprint for data storage.

5. What is a NoSQL database?

A NoSQL database is a flexible and scalable database management system that can handle diverse data types and large volumes. It diverges from traditional relational databases and is suitable for dynamic and rapidly evolving data models. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

6. How does it work?

NoSQL databases work with flexible schemas, accommodating diverse data types. They use different data models (document-oriented, key-value, wide-column, graph) and often support horizontal scalability by distributing data across multiple nodes. These databases provide specific query languages or APIs tailored to their models and optimize for performance in various use cases.

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?

* Collections: Containers for documents.
* Documents: Individual records in BSON format.
* Fields: Key-value pairs representing attributes.
* Indexes: Enhance query performance.
* Queries: JSON-like language for data retrieval.
* Aggregation Framework: Allows complex data transformations.
* GridFS (Optional): Handles large file storage.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB is more flexible than SQL due to its schema-less nature, accommodating dynamic and diverse data with ease.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases may lack standardized queries, have limited ACID transactions, pose a learning curve for developers, relax data integrity controls for performance, and may not have the same maturity or community support as traditional relational databases. They are best suited for specific use cases, and the choice depends on the application's requirements.
