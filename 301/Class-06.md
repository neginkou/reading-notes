Understanding HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH is essential in this module as they are foundational for effective data communication in web development and APIs. Proficiency in these methods is crucial for retrieving, submitting, and modifying data, forming the basis for building secure and efficient web applications.

1. To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?

 Psychological safety refers to the shared belief that a team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking, where team members feel comfortable being themselves and expressing their opinions without fear of reprisal.

In my previous work experience, the impact of psychological safety was depend on the culture of the organization or team. If psychological safety was high, it likely fostered open communication, innovation, and a sense of belonging. On the other hand, if psychological safety was lacking, it might have led to hesitation in expressing ideas or concerns, potentially hindering collaboration and creativity.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

Roy Fielding played a significant role in developing the HTTP specification, a protocol for the World Wide Web. He emphasized principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) in its design, outlined in his influential dissertation. 

4. What does a `GET` do?

A `GET` request in HTTP is used to retrieve data from a specified resource. It is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect. The requested data is included in the URL, making it visible and bookmarkable.

5. What does a `POST` do?

A `POST` request in HTTP is used to submit data to a specified resource for processing. Unlike GET, it's non-idempotent, involves data in the request body (not the URL), and is often used for secure or state-changing operations. It's typically not cached.

6. What does `PUT` do?

A `PUT` request in HTTP is used to update or create a resource at a specified URL. It's idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect. The data to be stored or updated is included in the request body.

7. What does `PATCH` do?

A `PATCH` request in HTTP is used to apply partial modifications to a resource. It allows clients to update specific fields without sending the entire representation of the resource. The data for modification is included in the request body, and the operation is idempotent.
