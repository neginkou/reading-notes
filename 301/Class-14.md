1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The personal computer revolution happened in the 1980s, coinciding with the decline of women in computer science.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It matters because the narrative that computers were for boys led to a gender gap. Families were more likely to buy computers for boys, creating a disparity in exposure and experience. This impacted female students later on, as professors assumed computer familiarity, disadvantaging those without early access.

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diversity efforts are most successful when driven by a commitment from company leaders who understand why diversity matters. A meaningful commitment involves acknowledging that diverse teams are smarter and more creative, leading to innovation and positive business outcomes.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse companies perform better because diverse teams are smarter and more creative, contributing to innovation. Research shows a strong correlation between diversity and positive financial outcomes. Failing to attract employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads to missing out on incredible talent, and biased hiring practices can significantly affect candidate evaluation.

When employees of an organization better represent their users, they can build more effectively for those groups. For example, YouTube's oversight by a right-handed developer team resulted in an iOS app that didn't consider left-handed users, leading to 5-10% of videos being uploaded upside down. Pinterest and Twitter executives emphasized that building features and striking partnerships aligned with the diversity of their user base enhances product quality and engagement.
