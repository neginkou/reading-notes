Creating RESTful APIs is vital for our module, aligning with core web development principles. It offers a structured approach to building efficient and standardized web services, crucial for scalable data interaction and adhering to industry best practices. Mastering these concepts ensures not just functional but also well-documented and maintainable APIs, making it essential for our studies.

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

* Use PUT if sending the entire updated resource.

* Use PATCH for partial updates.

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST: Architectural style for designing networked applications.
CRUD: Basic operations - Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Relationship:

RESTful APIs often implement CRUD using standard HTTP methods.
Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT/PATCH), Delete (DELETE).

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?


Define Resources:
Identify entities/resources.
Determine attributes and relationships.

Choose Endpoints:
Design URIs for resources.
Establish naming conventions.

Select HTTP Methods:
Assign CRUD operations to methods.
Define actions for each resource.

Create Data Models:
Design resource representations.
Set up a corresponding database schema.

Implement Logic and Documentation:
Develop server-side logic for CRUD.
Document API details, including endpoints and methods.
