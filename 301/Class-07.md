Mastering Node.js, npm, and pair programming is crucial for my studies as they form a core trio in modern software development. Node.js expands JavaScript to the server-side, npm simplifies dependency management, and pair programming enhances collaboration and code quality. These skills not only equip me for server-side development but also cultivate effective communication and continuous learning, essential in today's dynamic development landscape

1. What is node.js?

`Node.js` is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

`Chrome's V8` JavaScript Engine is a high-performance open-source JavaScript runtime engine developed by Google. It is specifically designed to execute JavaScript code in web browsers, and it serves as the core component of the Google Chrome browser. V8 translates JavaScript code into machine code directly, enabling faster execution.

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

When we say that `Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime, we mean that it provides an environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

4. What is npm?

`npm` stands for Node Package Manager. It is the default package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to easily manage and share packages (libraries, tools, and modules) written in JavaScript. npm simplifies the process of installing, updating, and managing dependencies in Node.js projects.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

v21.3.0

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

10.2.4

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called `‘jshint’`?

`npm install -g jshint`

8. What is node used for?

`Node.js` is used for building web servers, APIs, real-time applications, microservices, command-line tools, build tools, serverless applications, desktop applications, IoT projects, and data streaming applications. Its versatility and asynchronous nature make it suitable for a wide range of development purposes.

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. 


1. Greater Efficiency: Pair programming, despite taking a bit longer, yields higher-quality code that reduces troubleshooting efforts. Collaboration allows for faster problem-solving and idea generation, often making it more efficient than individual efforts in the long run.

2. Engaged Collaboration: Working together on the same code keeps programmers focused, minimizes procrastination, and encourages timely problem-solving. This shared responsibility enhances overall engagement and confidence in the coding process.

3. Learning from Peers: Pair programming exposes developers to diverse problem-solving techniques and approaches. It facilitates knowledge exchange among developers with different skill sets, promoting a collaborative learning environment.

4. ocial Skills Development: Pair programming improves communication and interpersonal skills, especially when dealing with different coding styles and personalities. This not only enhances programming abilities but also prepares individuals for effective teamwork in the long term.

5. Job Interview Readiness: Pair programming exercises are common in job interviews, providing companies with insights into an applicant's collaboration style and team fit. Strong collaboration and communication skills are often valued as much as technical expertise.

6. Work Environment Readiness: Companies using pair programming appreciate candidates familiar with collaborative practices. Graduates experienced in pair programming, like Code Fellows graduates, can seamlessly transition into a new job environment, reducing the learning curve for companies.

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Learning from Peers: In environments that prioritize continuous learning and knowledge sharing, the exposure to different problem-solving techniques may be highly valued.

3. How does pair programming work?

Pair programming involves two roles—Driver (actively coding) and Navigator (reviewing and guiding). Both switch roles frequently, promoting constant communication and knowledge sharing. The collaborative practice enhances code quality, error detection, and continuous learning. It's adaptable to various tasks and fosters a positive team dynamic. Developers work on the same machine with shared tools and often use version control.
