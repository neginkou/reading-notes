Understanding and implementing CORS in a Django project is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of your web application. By controlling access to your resources based on the origin of the request, CORS helps prevent unauthorized access and protects sensitive information.

1. What are the key principles to follow when organizing and configuring Django settings for a project, according to the “Django Settings Best Practices” reading?

1. Use separate settings files for different environments (development, testing, production).
2. Store sensitive information in environment variables.
3. Keep settings modular: use `base.py` for common settings and separate files for environment-specific settings.
4. Use `django-environ` for managing environment variables.
5. For complex settings, use `django-split-settings`.
6. Avoid hardcoding settings; use external sources for dynamic configuration.
7. Document settings clearly for easy understanding and modification.

2. How does the White Noise library contribute to the efficient serving of static files in a Django application, and what are the steps to integrate it into a project? 

White Noise serves static files directly from the application's filesystem, reducing the need for a separate server. To integrate it into a Django project:

* Install White Noise: pip install whitenoise
* Add 'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware' to MIDDLEWARE
* Set STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
* Run python manage.py collectstatic
* Use White Noise with your web server, e.g., for gunicorn: gunicorn myproject.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --log-file - --insecure

3. What is the purpose of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in web applications, and how can it be implemented and configured in a Django project to control access to resources?

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows web servers to specify who can access their resources. To implement it in Django using django-cors-headers:

* Install django-cors-headers: pip install django-cors-headers
* Add 'corsheaders' to INSTALLED_APPS
* Add 'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware' to MIDDLEWARE
* Configure CORS settings in your Django settings file, e.g., CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ['https://example.com']
* The middleware will handle adding the necessary CORS headers to responses.
