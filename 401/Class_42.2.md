* Cyber-Security of Self-Driving Cars:

The article discusses the cybersecurity risks of self-driving cars. It highlights that these vehicles are vulnerable to hacking due to their complex systems and internet connectivity. This raises concerns about public safety, as hackers could potentially take control of the cars. The article suggests that carmakers are working on making these systems more secure, but it's still a significant challenge. I agree that cybersecurity is a crucial aspect of self-driving cars and needs to be prioritized to ensure safety.

* Microsoft and the DoD:

This article talks about Microsoft employees protesting against the company's contract with the US Army for developing augmented reality technology. The employees are concerned about their work being used for warfare and violence. They are asking for a say in how their work is used and for Microsoft to stop developing weapons technology. The article shows the ethical dilemma in the tech industry about involvement in military projects. I agree that it's important for companies to have clear policies on the use of technology to ensure it's used responsibly.
