Understanding how to use Next.js to build scalable web applications is important for developers because it allows them to leverage the power of server-side rendering and efficient client-side routing provided by Next.js.

1. What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?

React Context is a feature that allows you to share data across the component tree without manually passing props. It's useful for managing global state. You create a context object with React.createContext() and provide it at the top of your component tree using Context.Provider. Components can consume this context using Context.Consumer or the useContext hook. 

2. Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.

The useContext hook in React allows you to consume a Context object's value in a functional component. It's an alternative to using the Context.Consumer component for consuming context in class components or nested components.

3. Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.

Next.js is a React framework that provides a way to build server-rendered React applications easily. It offers features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and simpler client-side routing. Next.js aims to make React development more productive and efficient by providing a set of conventions and tools.

One example from the Vercel Next.js Examples that demonstrates how Next.js can be used to build a scalable web application is the "Custom Server" example. This example shows how you can create a custom server with Next.js to handle API requests and serve dynamic content.
