# Web Scraping

XPath provides a flexible and reliable method for navigating complex document structures and selecting elements based on their attributes or position. This level of control is crucial for accurately gathering data from websites, making web scraping more effective and adaptable to diverse online sources.

1. What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?

The key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites are:

1. Content: Static sites have fixed content, while dynamic sites generate content on the fly.
2. Data Retrieval: Static sites are scraped by parsing HTML, while dynamic sites may require browser automation.
3. Page Loading: Static sites have all content in the initial HTML, while dynamic sites load content asynchronously.
4. Handling JavaScript: Static sites don't rely on JavaScript, while dynamic sites often do.
5. Data Extraction: Static sites use basic HTML parsing, while dynamic sites may require interacting with JavaScript-rendered elements.
6. Stability: Static sites are more stable for scraping, while dynamic sites may change frequently.
7. Speed and Performance: Scraping static sites is generally faster and more efficient than scraping dynamic sites.

2. Explain at least three techniques or best practices that can be employed to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites.

To avoid getting blocked while scraping websites:

1. Respect robots.txt.
2. Use a user-agent header and rate limiting to mimic human behavior.
3. Manage cookies and sessions, and consider rotating IP addresses or using proxies to prevent IP-based blocking.

3. What is Playwright, and how does it assist in web scraping tasks? Provide an example of a use case where Playwright would be particularly beneficial.

Playwright is an automation framework that aids web scraping by supporting multiple browsers, executing JavaScript, and simulating user interactions. It's beneficial for scraping dynamic websites, like Single Page Applications (SPAs), where traditional tools struggle. For example, Playwright can efficiently extract data from SPAs that load content dynamically via JavaScript.

4. Describe the purpose of using Xpath in web scraping, and provide an example of an Xpath expression to select a specific HTML element from a webpage.

XPath is used in web scraping to precisely select elements from webpages. For example, this XPath expression: //h1[@class='article-title'], targets the <h1> element with a class attribute "article-title" to extract the article title.
