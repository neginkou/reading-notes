1. What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?

Key Benefits of Django Custom User Model:

* Flexibility: Tailor user model with custom fields/methods.

* Scalability: Optimize structure for performance as app grows.

* Simplified Authentication: Use email, username, etc., as unique identifiers.

* Enhanced Security: Add custom password hashing, validation logic.

* Integration: Seamless integration with existing systems, external providers.

2. Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields.

* Create Custom User Model:

Define a model inheriting from AbstractBaseUser and PermissionsMixin.
Customize fields as needed (e.g., email as the username).

* Update `settings.py`:

Set `AUTH_USER_MODEL` to your custom user model (e.g., AUTH_USER_MODEL = `'your_app.CustomUser'`).

* Migrate Changes:

Run python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate.

* Test Your Custom User Model:
Create a superuser using createsuperuser to ensure everything works correctly.

3. What is DjangoX and how does it complement or extend the functionality of Django? Provide an example use case for incorporating DjangoX in a project.

DjangoX is a set of extensions for Django that enhances its functionality. It provides tools for user authentication, admin panel customization, and project templates, simplifying the development process and adding features not included in Django's core.
