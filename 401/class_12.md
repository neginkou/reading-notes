1. Explain the purpose and basic functionality of the Pandas library. What are some common operations that can be performed on data using Pandas, and how do they contribute to data analysis and manipulation?

Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series. Common operations include data loading, cleaning, selection, filtering, aggregation, and visualization. Pandas simplifies data analysis tasks and is widely used in data science.

2. What are the primary data structures in Pandas, and how do they differ in terms of use cases?

* DataFrame: This is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure resembling a spreadsheet or SQL table. It is used for storing and manipulating structured data with rows and columns. DataFrames are ideal for handling structured datasets like CSV files or database tables.

* Series: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type. It is similar to a single column in a DataFrame. Series are used for working with sequences of data, such as time series data or individual columns within a DataFrame.

3. Describe the process of loading a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. What are some common file formats that can be used, and which Pandas functions are utilized to read these formats?

Import Pandas: import pandas as pd.
Use the appropriate Pandas function based on the data format:

* CSV: pd.read_csv('filename.csv')
* Excel: pd.read_excel('filename.xlsx')
* SQL: pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM table_name', connection)
* JSON: pd.read_json('filename.json'), and more.
Customize loading options if needed.
Assign the loaded data to a DataFrame variable for analysis.
