1. What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?

* Jupyter Lab:

Versatile IDE-like environment.
Tabbed interface for all content.
Extensive extension system.
Advanced file management.
Suitable for complex projects.

* Jupyter Notebook:

Simple notebook-centric interface.
Tabbed interface for notebooks only.
Basic extension support.
Basic file navigation.
Suitable for simpler tasks.

2. What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

NumPy is a Python library that:

1. Offers efficient multi-dimensional array handling.
2. Provides mathematical operations and random number generation.
3. Supports data manipulation, indexing, and slicing.
4. Is crucial for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.
5. Integrates with other scientific libraries, making it essential for various tasks.

3. Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

* NumPy Arrays:

Homogeneous, multi-dimensional data structures.
Properties: shape, dtype, memory layout.

* Examples:

Creating: np.array(), np.zeros(), np.ones(), np.eye(), np.arange().
Manipulating: reshape, T, element-wise operations, slicing, concatenation.
Operations: sum, mean, max, min, matrix multiplication, element-wise comparison.
