1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

One of the more important things to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the efficiency of the required operations. Different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses, and their performance characteristics can vary depending on the type of operations you need to perform frequently.

For example, if your problem involves frequent insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning or middle of the collection, a linked list might be more suitable than an array. Linked lists excel at constant-time insertions and deletions in these scenarios. On the other hand, if your problem requires random access to elements and efficient searching, an array may be a better choice due to its constant-time random access capability.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

To avoid an infinite recursive call stack:

* Define a Base Case:
Identify the simplest scenario for the function to return a result.
* Make Progress:
Ensure each recursive call moves toward the base case.
* Check Termination Conditions:
Verify conditions lead to the base case eventually.
* Test Thoroughly:
Test with various inputs, including edge cases.
* Use Debugging:
Trace execution to identify issues.
* Understand Depth:
Be mindful of maximum recursion depth to prevent stack overflow.
