1. What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?

1. Models: Define data structure and interact with the database.

2. Views: Handle requests, process data, and return responses.

3. Templates: Generate dynamic HTML for presentation.

4. URL Dispatcher: Maps URLs to views for routing.

5. Forms: Handle user input and data validation.

6. Admin Interface: Automates CRUD operations for managing site content.

2. Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.

Django's MTV architecture divides tasks into:

* Model: Handles data interaction.

* View: Processes requests and prepares responses.

* Template: Generates HTML for presentation.

During a request:

* URL dispatcher routes to a view.

* View interacts with models and prepares data.

* Template renders HTML with the data.

* HTML response is sent back to the client.

3. What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?

* Tailwind CSS: Utility-first framework for highly customizable styling directly in HTML.

* Bootstrap CSS: Component-based framework with pre-designed UI components and responsive grid system.

Tailwind focuses on utility classes for flexibility, while Bootstrap offers pre-designed components for rapid development.
