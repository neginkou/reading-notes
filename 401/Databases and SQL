# Relational databases and SQL


A relational database is a structured collection of data organized in tables, where each table represents a specific entity or concept, and rows within the table correspond to individual records. The relationships between tables are established through keys, allowing for efficient and organized storage of data. This relational model is the foundation of Structured Query Language (SQL), a powerful domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

SQL, serves as a standardized means of interacting with relational databases. It provides a set of commands for tasks such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. SQL enables users to define the structure of a database, manipulate the data within it, and control access to the database.

Key features of SQL include its simplicity, declarative nature, and ability to handle complex queries. SQL commands such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `JOIN`, and `GROUP` BY allow users to perform a wide range of operations on data. Additionally, SQL supports transactions, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the database by allowing multiple operations to be treated as a single, atomic unit.

Relational databases and SQL play a crucial role in modern information systems, providing a reliable and scalable solution for data storage and retrieval. They are widely used in various industries and applications, from business operations and finance to healthcare and beyond. The structured and organized nature of relational databases, combined with the versatility of SQL, makes them indispensable tools for managing and extracting valuable insights from vast amounts of data.
