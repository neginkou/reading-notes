1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can? 

What sets me apart in this career is my rare combination of strong problem-solving skills and creativity.I've consistently found innovative solutions that enhance both functionality and user satisfaction. My ability to bridge the technical and creative aspects of development allows me to bring a fresh perspective to challenges, ultimately driving project success.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

To overcome challenges in tough code or logic, I'll adopt a multi-faceted approach. First, I'll proactively utilize online resources and community forums to explore different perspectives and solutions. Second, I'll actively seek feedback from my colleagues, fostering a collaborative environment where we can collectively brainstorm and troubleshoot. Lastly, I recognize the value of taking breaks to gain fresh insights. Stepping away from the code for a short time allows me to return with a clear mind and often leads to breakthroughs in problem-solving.
