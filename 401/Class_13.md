1. Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

Linear Regression is a statistical method used in machine learning and data analysis to model and predict relationships between variables. It's a tool for prediction, understanding relationships, and evaluating the significance of variables in explaining outcomes. It assumes a linear relationship between variables and helps us make predictions and draw insights.

2. Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

1. Import Libraries:
Import necessary libraries.

2. Prepare Data:
Load and split your data into X (independent variables) and y (dependent variable).

3. Split Data:
Split your data into training and testing sets.

4. Create and Train the Model:
Initialize the Linear Regression model.
Fit the model to the training data.

5. Make Predictions:
Use the trained model to predict values on the test data.

6. Evaluate the Model:
Calculate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score to assess the model's performance.

7. Optional Visualization:
Visualize the regression line and data points.

8. Use the Model for Predictions:
Deploy the model for making predictions on new data.

3. What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?

* Training: The model learns from the training set.
* Testing: The test set assesses how well the model generalizes.
* Prevents Overfitting: Checks for overfitting (poor performance on test data).
* Measuring Performance: Metrics quantify model accuracy.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust settings for better performance.
* Model Comparison: Compare different models on the same test set.
